- building a music player app using SvelteKit and the Soundcloud API.
- mix theoretical knowledge with hands on experience
- (we will use tailwind CSS but ultimately styles are up to you)

# Introduction to Svelte


---

## Not just another JS framework

- created by Rich Harris
- most JS frameworks have an abstraction layer that needs to be shipped with the production bundle, making it larger
- svelte manipulates the code in the compiler, 
- compiled to (performant) vanilla JS
- same great DX
- smaller bundle sizes

---

## RactiveJS

- predecessor to Svelte
- it was an unopinionated library
- focused on creating highly interactive and reactive data views
- (Rich was working as a journalist for the Guardian (UK newspaper) at the time so needed enticing content)
- but he still felt it was shipping too much JS

---

## The dawn of Svelte

- 2016 - Svelte version 1, was essentially RactiveJS with a compiler (Rollup + Snowpack, then moved to Vite in 2021)
- it's not backed by a big company (unlike Angular & React)
- completely community run
- the core team has been expanding along with the community of users
- 2019, Svelte made it onto the State of JavaScript leaderboard with 88% retention
- it has remained around 90% since then

---
- since its creation, it has already been put into production for some global companies
## Svelte in production:
	1. IBM
	2. 1Password
	3. Rakuten
	4. The New York Times
	5. Philips
	6. Avast
	7. Apple

## Introducing Sapper

- 2017, the Svelte team began building Sapper, 
- it was a metaframework to help build full apps with Svelte. 
- Until this point, Svelte could only be used to create components which could then be compiled and dropped into existing apps.

- Sapper had plenty of cutting edge ideas including:
- Server-side rendering by default, 
- code-splitting,
- an opinionated project structure.
- Sapper never reached version 1.0, in a video Rich explains 


that the codebase had become too difficult to work with, but the team had learned a lot and so they took all of those learning with them, introducing...

## SvelteKit
	The new kid in town

- 2020, rebranding Sapper as SvelteKit and giving it the final push towards its v1.0 release.

- late 2022, SvelteKit 1.0 was released (already used before 1.0, was just a cut off for "no more breaking changes").
