# Introduction to Svelte


---

## Not just another JS framework

- most JS frameworks have an abstraction layer that needs to be shipped with the production bundle, making it larger
- svelte manipulates the code in the compiler, 
- compiled to (performant) vanilla JS
- same great DX
- smaller bundle sizes

---

## RactiveJS

- predecessor to Svelte
- it was an unopinionated library
- focused on creating highly interactive and reactive data views
- (Rich was working as a journalist for the Guardian (UK newspaper) at the time so needed enticing content)


---

## The dawn of Svelte

- 2016 - Svelte version 1, was essentially RactiveJS with a compiler
- the core team has been expanding along with the community of users
- 2019, Svelte made it onto the State of JavaScript leaderboard with 88% retention
- it has slightly increased to just under 90% in 2022

## Introducing Sapper

- 2017, the Svelte team began building Sapper, 
- it was a metaframework to help build full apps with Svelte. 
- Until this point, Svelte could only be used to create components which could then be compiled and dropped into existing apps.

- Sapper had plenty of cutting edge ideas including:
- Server-side rendering by default, 
- code-splitting,
- an opinionated project structure.

## Sveltekit
	The new kid in town

- 2020, the decision was made to move away from Sapper, 
- rebranding as Sveltekit and giving it the final push towards its v1.0 release.

- late 2022, Sveltekit 1.0 was released (already used before 1.0, was just a cuts for "no more breaking changes").
